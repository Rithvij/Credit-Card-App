# Credit-Card-App
This Angular app features a credit card form with real-time validation and input masking. Users can enter details like name, card number, expiration date, and security code, with dynamic error messages for invalid inputs. The app uses reactive forms, custom validators, and a live preview of card details as the form is filled out.
